How to run:

Pre-conditions:
All of the positive cases need be edited to your own phone number, email, sepulsa account. So i filled it blank in positive cases.

1. First you need to install Java SDK 19 version, dont' use SDK 20 because Selenium still (as of my commit) doesn't support it so it will give an error. Then install Intellij IDE.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open this file using Intellij IDE.
4. Install depedencies in the maven pom.xml.
5. Open src/test/java/runner to see all the feature that you can run.
6. Run with debugger using Intellij.
7. You'll see in folder src/test/resources/reports/ to see the test reports.
